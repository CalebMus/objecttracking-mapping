# Multi-Object Tracking For Strategic Sports Analysis

## Overview
This project implements advanced computer vision techniques to track and analyze player movements in sports videos. Developed by Caleb Musfeldt, Sreeram Kondapalli, and Will Janes as part of their Data Science Capstone (Fall 2024), it aims to automate sports film analysis to help teams make informed strategic decisions.
